Learning science can be interesting and effective only if the concepts are concrete. The learning domain must facilitate an opportunity to explore and ask innumerable questions on **“why” and “how”**. This makes learning extend beyond a rigid frame work. This can only bring to the child the joy of learning and discovery begins here.

The Power Point Presentations **(PPTs)** here are supplied with copious images to support and clarify the concepts. The **Concept maps** are aimed to put all concepts in a convenient form so as to facilitate memorizing. Thus linking the concepts and the evolution of the ideas become easy. **Experiential** part of learning is strongly connected to learning the concepts. Efforts are made to achieve experiential learning in the child’s immediate environment in a convenient way. When the child puts the mind and the body together learning combines with emotion so that memory consolidation takes place. 
A good deal of care has been given to evaluation of learning outcome. The **exercise** are in progressive manner. Thought provoking and curiosity arousing questions are added to sustain the child’s interest. Exercises from NCERT Science **Exemplar** Problems are also included so that the child can get more opportunity to learn effectively.

We are confident that facilitating learning extension help the child to widen the area of exploration. This will leave no child discontented of having been confined to a rigid frame work. 

*In all, a holistic learning approach is attempted with meticulous care.*
